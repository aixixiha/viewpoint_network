Experience shows, however, that extracting facts from programs written in a wide range of programming and application languages is labour-intensive and error-prone. We present DeFacto, a new technique for fact extraction. It amounts to annotating the context-free grammar of a language of interest with fact annotations that describe how to extract elementary facts for language elements such as, for instance, a declaration or use of a variable, a procedure or method call, or control flow statements. Once the elementary facts have been extracted, we use relational techniques to further enrich them and to perform the actual software analysis.We motivate and describe our approach, sketch a prototype implementation and assess it using various examples.

The preliminary results of our research based on training 155 faculty members from 36 engineering colleges are encouraging and point to the potential benefits of multiple levels of personalization and customization which we have explored.\", \"viewpoints\": \"Your Answer:\\n[Sentence 1]\\nIndividuals differ in their abilities to learn new concepts.\\n[Extracted Viewpoint in Sentence 1]\\n[Individuals differ in their abilities to learn new concepts.]\\n[Sentence 2]\\nHowever, traditional learning paradigms treat all individuals alike and standardize learning materials and delivery systems.\\n[Extracted Viewpoint in Sentence 2]\\n[Traditional learning paradigms treat all individuals alike and standardize learning materials and delivery systems.]\\n[Sentence 3]\\nWe have observed that customized learning environments in the learning by doing mode enhance the learning experience better than standardized learning environments.\\n[Extracted Viewpoint in Sentence 3]\\n[Customized learning environments in the learning by doing mode enhance the learning experience better than standardized learning environments.]\\n[Sentence 4]\\nThe preliminary results of our research based on training 155 faculty members from 36 engineering colleges are encouraging and point to the potential benefits of multiple levels of personalization and customization which we have explored.\\n[Extracted Viewpoint in Sentence 4]\\n[Our preliminary research results based on training 155 faculty members from 36 engineering colleges are encouraging and point to the potential benefits of multiple levels of personalization and customization in learning environments.]\"}\n",
